# Birthday paradox simulation

This small project simulates the [birthday paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).

Several simulations are run to calculate an approximate probability of two people having the same birthday in a given set of random people.

The results of the simulations are also plotted on a histogram for a better understanding of the phenomenon.
